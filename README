A plug-in for JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA 6 which provides real-time feedback
against a given CheckStyle (http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/)
profile by way of an inspection.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING - if you've download the source from svn you'll be chuffed to
          know it's currently unstable. Surprise! :-) Stable code can
          be had from the IDEA Plugin Repository, or there might be a
          tag for the last version.

          The WIP is the static-scanning support... shouldn't be far
          off a stable code base again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Use
---

Once installed, a new inspection will be available in the group 'CheckStyle'.
The 'Errors' item in the preferences panel will allow you to turn this on
and to configure it.


Configuration
-------------

Currently the only configuration option is that of the CheckStyle file. If
this field is left empty then the Sun checks, as supplied with CheckStyle, will
be used. Pointing this at the file of your choice will result in the contained
rules being used.


Limitations
-----------

This is an initial release and has some notable limitations:

* Properties within configuration files cannot be defined or edited.
* CheckStyle errors and warnings are both shown at a single level, as IDEA
  will only allow one warning level for an inspection.
* Error handling is somewhat basic at present.


Feedback
--------

Any comments or bug reports are most welcome - please visit

Acknowledgements
----------------

This plug-in owes its existence to both the style-overlords at work mandating
compliance with a CheckStyle configuration, and the Eclispe-CS
(http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/) authors for making me jealous of the
real-time scan support available for Eclipse.

In particular, thanks are due to the authors and contributors of:

* Eclispe-CS, for inspiration and solutions to coding problems.
* JetStyle, for filling the area of static scanning and also giving me
  inspirations on coding solutions.
* CheckStyle, for without them we'd have merely void and chaos.
* JetBrains, for an IDE which is worth every penny and them some.
